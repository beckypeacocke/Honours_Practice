## Bird Mock Project

This is mock honours project using data from a project that I did for BIO3013F 
Global Change course.

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
