## Bird Mock Project

This is mock honours project using data from a project that I did for the BIO3013F 
Global Change course. The data includes sightings of birds in an urban area (UCT
upper campus) and a non-urban area (Kirstenbosch).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
